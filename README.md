# PCA-for-Diagnosis-of-Heart-Disease
In this project, I applied Principal Component Analysis to study the performance of clustering algorithms on the Cleveland heart disease dataset. The report is divided into two parts. In the first section, we apply PCA on a dataset of 303 people corresponding to the 14 specific features. We found that 88.3% of the explained variance was in the first 2 principal components. In the second section, we have used logistic regression for classifying the observations.
